#openQCM Software Java#

This is my, tweaked version of the openQCM with additional functionality. I take no responsibility for correctness of this software, as this is a hobby project.

The **openQCM GUI** is designed to accomplish the following tasks:

1. **Connect Arduino** find the COM port and set the serial connection between the Arduino board and your PC.
2. **Read Data** read the QCM frequency and temperature data available at the connection COM port.
3. **Plot Data** plot the QCM frequency and temperature data using a real time chart.
4. **Save Data** save the frequency and temperature data in a text file.
